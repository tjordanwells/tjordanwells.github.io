            <p>My name is Jordan Wells and I am based out of Raleigh, North Carolina. I am a coffee and beer enthusiast (who isn't these days?) and am currently obsessed with the Video Vortex at Alamo Drafthouse. I am a big fan of baseball, primarily the Los Angeles Dodgers, and try to make it out West at least once every year.</p><br>
            <p>I play one instrument well and a few others well enough. I currently contribute to the band The Born Agains sonically as well as visually in the way of intentially spliced film. Think of it as a visual companion to music, rather than music being an audible companion to film.</p><br>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at UNC-Chapel Hill where I am learning the art of Web Development.</p>
